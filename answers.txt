Q1: Why might we consider using Git?

Answer: We might consider using Git because it helps track changes to files over time, making it easy to see what was modified, when, and by whom. It allows multiple people to collaborate on the same project without overwriting each other's work through branching and merging features. Git also provides a backup of project history, so you can revert to earlier versions if something breaks.
